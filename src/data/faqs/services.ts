    question: "How fast can Zumetrix Labs build a production-ready SaaS MVP?",
    answer:
      "For most focused products, we can take you from idea to a production-ready SaaS MVP in about 30 days. That timeline usually fits dashboards, internal tools, niche SaaS products, or marketplaces with a clear first feature set. Our process covers scoping, architecture, UI flows, development, integrations (such as Stripe or OpenAI), testing, and deployment to production on platforms like Vercel, Supabase, or AWS. For more complex products or multiple user roles, we’ll propose a slightly longer timeline so we don’t compromise on quality."
  },
  {
    question: "What does your SaaS MVP development process include?",
    answer:
      "Our SaaS MVP service is more than just writing code. We start with a strategy and discovery call, clarify your target users and key use cases, then design the core flows and data model. From there, we implement the frontend (usually React/Next.js), backend APIs (Node.js/TypeScript), authentication, payments or subscriptions (Stripe), and any required integrations (OpenAI, Firebase, Airtable, etc.). We handle QA, deployment, and a structured handover so you have a product you can demo, onboard early users into, and build on top of."
  },
  {
    question: "Which technologies and tech stack do you use for client projects?",
    answer:
      "We primarily work with React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React Native, Expo, Firebase, Supabase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Stripe, and OpenAI. For automations and internal tools we often use Airtable, Notion, Zapier, Make.com, and n8n. We choose the stack based on what fits your product, your team, and your long-term plans—not just what is trendy. Our goal is to give you a system that performs well, is maintainable, and can be handed over or grown without a full rewrite."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer AI and automation services for existing businesses?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A large part of our work is helping teams automate and augment existing workflows using AI and no-code tools. This can include AI-assisted support, document processing, lead qualification, internal assistants, and automated flows that connect tools like Stripe, HubSpot, Airtable, Notion, and Google Sheets. We design and build the automations, connect them to your existing systems, and make sure there is a clear way to monitor and adjust them as your business evolves."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of ongoing support and maintenance do you provide?",
    answer:
      "After launch, we can either hand everything over to your internal team or stay on as your technical partner. Our ongoing support typically includes bug fixes, small improvements, new features, performance tuning, and help with production incidents. Some clients prefer a fixed monthly retainer, others work with us on a block-of-hours basis. We’ll recommend a model based on how fast you expect to iterate and how critical the system is to your business."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate into an existing codebase or team?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We regularly join existing teams or step into live codebases to help with specific problems: refactoring, new modules, complex integrations, or performance issues. Before starting, we review your existing architecture and repos, agree on scope and priorities, and then work alongside your team with clear communication and code review practices. The goal is to add value without creating more complexity for your developers later."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of projects are the best fit for Zumetrix Labs?",
    answer:
      "We’re a strong fit if you need: (1) a SaaS product or internal tool, (2) a modern web dashboard or analytics platform, (3) a React Native mobile app, or (4) AI/automation flows that reduce manual work and connect multiple systems. Our sweet spot is founder-led startups and small teams that want direct access to senior engineers and a clear path from idea to shipped product."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you structure pricing for your services?",
    answer:
      "For clearly defined projects like SaaS MVPs, we usually work on a fixed-price, fixed-scope basis so you know exactly what you’re getting. For ongoing work, automations, and long-term partnerships, we often use monthly retainers or flexible blocks of hours. As a rough guideline, focused SaaS MVPs typically start around $8,000–$15,000, automation projects from $3,000–$7,000, and larger or more complex builds are priced after a detailed discovery call. Every proposal includes a breakdown of scope, timeline, and responsibilities."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure quality and reliability in the software you ship?",
    answer:
      "We take architecture and code quality seriously. That means: clear separation of frontend and backend concerns, typed APIs where possible, environment-based configs, proper handling of errors and edge cases, basic test coverage on critical paths, and documentation for deployment and configuration. We also keep scope focused so we can ship a solid, stable V1 instead of a fragile product overloaded with half-finished features."
  },
  {
    question: "I’m not technical. Can you still help me bring my idea to life?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many of our clients are non-technical founders, operators, or domain experts. Our job is to translate your vision and business logic into clear product flows, architecture, and decisions. We keep communication straightforward, avoid unnecessary jargon, and make sure you always understand what we’re building and why. You bring the idea and domain knowledge; we handle the product and engineering side."
