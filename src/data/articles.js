      <h2>Mobile App Development: Flutter vs React Native</h2>
      <p>Choosing the right mobile development framework is crucial for startup success. At Zumetrix Labs, we've built 20+ mobile apps using both Flutter and React Native.</p>
      
      <h3>React Native Advantages</h3>
      <p>React Native offers faster development for teams already familiar with React. It provides excellent performance and has a mature ecosystem with extensive third-party libraries.</p>
      
      <h3>Flutter Benefits</h3>
      <p>Flutter provides pixel-perfect UI consistency across platforms and excellent performance. It's Google's framework with growing popularity and strong documentation.</p>
      
      <h3>Our Recommendation</h3>
      <p>For Pakistani startups, we typically recommend React Native due to the larger developer pool and easier hiring. However, Flutter is excellent for apps requiring complex UI animations.</p>
