## 🚨 COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### **❌ Mistake #1: No Clear Brief**
Designer guesses what you want, wastes time on wrong direction.

**Solution:** Use project request template every time.

---

### **❌ Mistake #2: Too Many Revisions**
"Can you try this... and this... and this..."

**Solution:** Limit to 2 rounds of revisions. Get it right in the brief.

---

### **❌ Mistake #3: Slow Feedback**
Designer delivers, you take 1 week to review.

**Solution:** Review and respond within 24-48 hours.

---

### **❌ Mistake #4: Micromanaging**
"Move this 2 pixels left"

**Solution:** Trust their expertise. Focus on outcomes, not details.

---

### **❌ Mistake #5: Scope Creep**
"Can you also design this, and this, and this..."

**Solution:** Stick to original brief. New requests = new projects.

---

## 🎓 WORKING WITH DESIGNERS: BEST PRACTICES

### **✅ DO:**

1. **Provide Clear Briefs**

   - Wastes time
   - Frustrates designer
   - Costs more

3. **Expect Mind Reading**
   - If you have a vision, communicate it

4. **Compare to Unrealistic Standards**

   - "Can you do it like [expensive agency]?"

5. **Delay Payment**
