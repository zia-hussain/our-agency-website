    question: "Who are Zia Hussain and Syed Omer Shah?",
    answer:
      "Zia Hussain and Syed Omer Shah are the co-founders of Zumetrix Labs, a founder-led software studio based in Pakistan and working with clients worldwide. Zia (Co-Founder & CEO) focuses on product strategy and full-stack development using React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and Firebase. Omer (Co-Founder & CTO) focuses on backend systems, AI automation, scalable architecture, and cloud infrastructure. Together, they personally lead architecture, critical development decisions, and client communication on every project instead of hiding behind a sales team."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes Zia and Omer different from other software developers and agencies?",
    answer:
      "Most agencies separate sales, management, and development. At Zumetrix Labs, Zia and Omer stay hands-on with both the code and the business context. They combine deep technical skills in React/Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, React Native, AI automation, and modern DevOps with a strong understanding of product, user experience, and business outcomes. This means you get senior-level thinking on architecture, scalability, and product strategy—not just task execution. Their founder-led approach is ideal for clients who want a true technical partner they can speak to directly."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I work directly with Zia and Omer on my project?",
    answer:
      "Yes. When you work with Zumetrix Labs, you work directly with the founders. Zia and Omer are involved from the first strategy call through architecture, implementation, and launch. They typically handle core architecture, complex features, integrations, and code reviews themselves, and only delegate well-defined tasks when it makes sense. This setup gives you direct access to senior engineers and clear answers instead of being passed around between account managers."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of international clients do they usually work with?",
    answer:
      "Zia and Omer primarily work with founders, small teams, and growing companies in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East. Many of their clients are building SaaS products, internal dashboards, analytics platforms, AI-powered tools, or mobile apps for specific niches. They are used to working across time zones, aligning with stakeholders who may not be technical, and turning vague ideas into clear technical roadmaps and working software."
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies and services do they personally specialize in?",
    answer:
      "Zia specializes in product-thinking and full-stack development using React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Firebase, Supabase, Stripe, and TailwindCSS. He is usually responsible for shaping the user experience, core flows, and overall technical direction of the product. Omer specializes in backend engineering, AI automation, Python-based services, cloud architecture (AWS, Vercel), and modern integration tools such as OpenAI, Zapier, Make.com, and n8n. Together, they deliver SaaS MVPs, custom web applications, React Native mobile apps, AI-assisted products, and automation systems that connect tools like Stripe, Airtable, Notion, and internal CRMs."
  },
  {
    question: "How experienced are Zia and Omer in leading real-world projects?",
    answer:
      "Before and through Zumetrix Labs, Zia and Omer have worked on a wide range of real-world projects: publishing analytics dashboards, marketplace apps, mobile booking apps, AI-powered tools, automation-heavy back-office systems, and internal tools for international clients. They are comfortable stepping into complex, partially built systems as well as starting greenfield projects from scratch. Their experience is less about big-company titles and more about shipping real products, fixing hard problems, and being the technical founders that clients can rely on long-term."
