    question: "How soon can we start working together?",
    answer:
      "Most projects begin within 7–10 days after the initial call and proposal approval. If your timeline is tight or you have a launch deadline, we’ll do our best to accommodate earlier starts. The goal is to give you a clear plan, not rush you into unclear work."
  },
  {
    question: "What do you need from me before sending a quote?",
    answer:
      "You don’t need a full specification — a simple description of your idea, your goals, and the problem you’re trying to solve is enough for us to start. If you already have wireframes, references, or feature notes, we’ll gladly look at them. Our first call is designed to help shape the project so we can give an accurate timeline and proposal."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with clients in different countries and time zones?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Most of our clients are in the US, UK, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East. We structure communication around your time zone, keep updates predictable, and use tools like Slack, email, WhatsApp, and Loom for smooth async collaboration. Working globally is a normal part of our process."
  },
  {
    question: "How do payment and project milestones work?",
    answer:
      "For fixed-scope projects like SaaS MVPs, we use milestone-based payments: an upfront start payment, one or two progress milestones, and a final delivery milestone. For ongoing work, we use monthly retainers or flexible blocks of hours. All proposals clearly outline scope, deliverables, pricing, and timelines with no hidden fees."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after I submit the contact form?",
    answer:
      "You’ll get a reply within 24 hours with next steps. Usually this includes a short message from one of the founders, a link to book a call, and a request for any details you’d like to share. The goal is simple: understand your idea, confirm fit, and outline a clear path forward."
