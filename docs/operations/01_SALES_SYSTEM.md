## DISCOVERY CALL STRUCTURE (30 MIN)

### Pre-Call (5 min before)
- [ ] Review their form submission
- [ ] Check their website/LinkedIn
- [ ] Note any red flags
- [ ] Decide if this is likely a fit BEFORE you dial

### Minutes 0-5: Set Frame
**You:** "Thanks for taking the time. I have 30 minutes blocked. My goal is to understand if we can actually help you, and be honest if we can't. Sound good?"

**Why this works:** You're establishing authority and mutual respect. Not begging for the deal.

### Minutes 5-15: Qualification Questions (ASK IN ORDER)

**Q1: "What are you trying to build, and why now?"**
- Listen for: Clarity of vision, urgency, whether they've thought this through
- Red flag: Vague answers, "I have an idea for an app"

**Q2: "Who's paying for this? Are you self-funded or raising?"**
- Listen for: Budget reality, decision authority
- Red flag: "We'll raise money after we build it" (usually means broke)

**Q3: "What happens if you don't build this?"**
- Listen for: Real pain vs nice-to-have
- Red flag: "Nothing really, just thought it would be cool"

**Q4: "Have you talked to other agencies? Why didn't you move forward?"**
- Listen for: What they value, what scared them away
- Red flag: Price shopping across 10+ agencies

**Q5: "What does success look like 90 days from now?"**
- Listen for: Realistic expectations, whether they understand MVP
- Red flag: "I want it to be the next Uber"

### Minutes 15-20: Scope Reality Check

If they pass qualification:

**You:** "Here's what I'm thinking. This sounds like [brief technical summary]. Realistically, we're looking at:
- 4-6 weeks for MVP
- $15K-$35K depending on complexity
- Weekly check-ins, not daily hand-holding
- You'll need to make decisions fast

Does that timeline and ballpark make sense, or are you expecting something different?"

**Why this works:** You're pre-framing budget and timeline. If they flinch at $15K, you just saved yourself 2 weeks of proposal work.

### Minutes 20-25: Objection Handling

**Common objections and responses:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "That's more than I expected" | "What were you expecting, and how'd you arrive at that number?" (Usually reveals research or lack thereof) |
| "Can you break it into phases?" | "Sure, but understand: Phase 1 alone won't be usable. You need X + Y minimum to launch. Thoughts?" |
| "Other agencies quoted less" | "Cool, go with them. Seriously. If price is the deciding factor, we're not the right fit." |
| "Can I see a detailed proposal first?" | "I don't write proposals for free. If we're aligned, I'll send a 1-page scope + price. Then we decide together." |

### Minutes 25-30: Next Steps (NEVER END WITHOUT THIS)

**Option A - Good Fit:**
"Great, here's what happens next:
1. I'll send you a 1-page scope doc + pricing by [specific date]
2. You review and respond within 48 hours (yes, no, or questions)
3. If yes, I send contract + 50% invoice
4. We kick off [specific week]

Can you commit to that timeline?"

**Option B - Maybe:**
"I need to think about this. Let me send you a brief follow-up email with some questions. If you answer them within 24 hours, we'll know if this makes sense."

**Option C - Not a Fit:**
"I'm going to be honest—I don't think we're the right fit. [Specific reason]. I'd recommend [alternative solution or competitor]. Appreciate your time."

## QUALIFICATION RULES (WHO WE REJECT)

### REJECT IF:

| Scenario | Why | How to Reject |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| Budget under $10K | Not worth the overhead | "We start at $15K minimum. If that's out of range, we're not the right fit right now." |
| No clear decision maker | You'll chase ghosts for weeks | "Who else needs to approve this? Let's get them on the next call or pause until they're available." |
| "Just need a developer" mentality | They want order-takers | "We don't do staff aug. We're thinking partners or nothing. If you need execution only, try Upwork." |
| Unrealistic timeline | Sets you up for failure | "You're asking for 3 months of work in 3 weeks. That's not happening. Here's realistic timeline..." |
| Scope creep in discovery | They'll be a nightmare client | "You've changed requirements 3 times on this call. We need clarity first. Come back when you know what you want." |
| Chronic price shoppers | Will never value your work | "Sounds like you need the cheapest option. That's not us. Good luck." |
| Red flag personality | Trust your gut | "After thinking about it, I don't think we're aligned. Best of luck with your project." |

### ACCEPT IF:

- They've thought through the problem deeply
- They have real budget allocated (not fantasy money)
- They make decisions quickly
- They respect expertise and pushback
- Their success metrics are clear and realistic
- You'd be proud to showcase this work

## PRICING LOGIC

### Base Framework (Adjust by 20% based on complexity)

| Project Type | Base Price | Timeline |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Simple MVP (CRUD, basic UI) | $15K-$20K | 3-4 weeks |
| Standard SaaS MVP | $25K-$35K | 4-6 weeks |
| Complex Dashboard | $30K-$45K | 5-7 weeks |
| AI/Automation Integration | $20K-$40K | 4-6 weeks |
| Full Platform (auth, payments, admin) | $40K-$60K | 6-8 weeks |

### Multipliers (Stack These)

| Factor | Multiplier |
|--------|-----------|
| Tight deadline (under 4 weeks) | +30% |
| Third-party API integration (per complex API) | +$3K-$5K |
| Client is difficult/indecisive (you'll know) | +40% "asshole tax" |
| Migration from legacy system | +50% |
| Needs ongoing support retainer | Separate: $3K-$8K/month |

### How to Present Pricing

**WRONG:**
"We charge $120/hour and estimate 200 hours."

**RIGHT:**
"This is a $28K fixed-price project. Includes:
- Core MVP features [list 4-5]
- 6 weeks of development
- Weekly sync calls
- 1 round of revision post-launch
- Deployment + handoff

NOT included:
- Ongoing support (that's separate)
- Marketing/design assets
- Third-party API costs
- Feature requests after scope approval"

---

## PROPOSAL FLOW

### Step 1: Verbal Alignment (On Call)
Get their reaction to ballpark pricing. If they don't flinch, proceed.

### Step 2: 1-Page Scope Doc (Send Within 24 Hours)

**Template:**

```
PROJECT SCOPE: [Project Name]
Date: [Date]
Valid for: 7 days

OVERVIEW:
[2-3 sentences about what you're building and why]

DELIVERABLES:
- [Specific feature 1]
- [Specific feature 2]
- [Specific feature 3]
- [Specific feature 4]
- Source code + deployment
- 1-hour handoff training

OUT OF SCOPE:
- [Thing they asked about that's extra]
- [Another thing]
- Ongoing maintenance (available separately)

TIMELINE: [X] weeks from kickoff
PRICE: $[XX,XXX] (50% upfront, 50% on completion)

NEXT STEPS:
Reply within 48 hours: Yes, No, or Questions.
If yes, I'll send contract + invoice.

Questions? Call me: [Your number]
```

### Step 3: Follow-Up (If No Response in 48 Hours)

**Email subject:** "Re: [Project] - Still interested?"

**Body:**
"Hey [Name],

Sent the scope doc on [date]. Haven't heard back.

Three options:
1. You're interested → Reply and let's move forward
2. You're not interested → Reply "not moving forward" so I can close this out
3. You have questions → Call me at [number] or reply with questions

If I don't hear from you by [date], I'll assume this isn't a priority and close this out.

Thanks,
[You]"

### Step 4: Contract + Invoice (If They Say Yes)

Use a simple contract (not 30 pages). Key sections:
- Scope (copy from your doc)
- Timeline + milestones
- Payment terms (50/50 or 33/33/33 for long projects)
- Change order process (+ how much extra work costs)
- IP ownership (they own it after final payment)
- Kill clause (either party can end with 7 days notice, pay for work done)

**Tool:** Bonsai, PandaDoc, or Google Docs + DocuSign

---

## FOLLOW-UP SOP

### If They Go Dark After Proposal

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 48 hours | Send "Still interested?" email |
| 5 days | Send "Closing this out" email |
| 7 days | Mark as Closed Lost, note reason |
| 90 days | (Optional) "Hey, still working on [project]?" email |

### If They Say "Not Now"

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "Budget isn't there yet" | "No problem. Reach out when you have $XX allocated." (Mark as Closed Lost) |
| "Need to talk to my co-founder" | "Got it. When are you talking? I'll follow up [day after that conversation]." |
| "Timing isn't right" | "Understood. When's a better time?" (Get specific date, follow up then) |

### If They're "Interested But Not Moving"

After 3 follow-ups with no decision: **WALK AWAY.**

Send: "Hey [Name], I've followed up a few times. Seems like this isn't a priority right now, which is totally fine. If things change, you know where to find me. Good luck with everything."

Then mark as Closed Lost and move on. Chasing lukewarm leads is how you go broke.

## METRICS TO TRACK (WEEKLY)

| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Leads → Discovery Calls | 30-50% | Under 20% (bad lead quality) |
| Discovery → Proposal | 50-70% | Under 40% (bad qualification) |
| Proposal → Closed | 40-60% | Under 30% (pricing wrong or proposal sucks) |
| Average Deal Size | $25K+ | Under $15K (too small) |
| Sales Cycle Length | 7-14 days | Over 30 days (you're begging) |

---

## RED FLAGS THAT MEAN YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG

- You're writing 10-page proposals
- You're negotiating for weeks
- You're offering discounts before they ask
- You're afraid to name your price
- You're saying "let me check with my team" (you ARE the team)
- You're chasing people who don't respond
- You're taking every project that comes through

**Remember:** You're not desperate. You're selective. Act like it.
