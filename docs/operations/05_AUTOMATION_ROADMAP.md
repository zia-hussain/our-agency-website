# AUTOMATION ROADMAP (12 MONTHS)
**Last Updated:** Dec 2025
**For:** Zumetrix Labs - What to Automate, When, and What to Keep Human

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

**Automate the repeatable. Keep the valuable human.**

The goal is NOT to remove yourself completely. The goal is to eliminate low-value repetitive work so you can focus on high-value activities (sales, strategy, client relationships, hard problems).

**Good automation = more time for what matters**
**Bad automation = robotic experience that kills trust**

---

**Tools:** Buffer ($6/mo), Hypefury ($15/mo), or Zapier + social APIs

## WHAT MUST NEVER BE AUTOMATED

### 1. Discovery Calls
**Why:** This is where you qualify, build trust, and establish authority. Clients are buying YOU. A bot can't do this.

### 2. Scoping + Pricing Decisions
**Why:** Every project is different. Requires judgment, experience, intuition. A template helps, but final call is yours.

### 3. High-Stakes Client Conversations
**Why:** When things go wrong, they want the founder. When they're nervous, they want the founder. Don't outsource this.

### 4. Hiring Decisions
**Why:** Your team quality = your agency quality. You need to vet people directly.

### 5. Scope Protection / Saying No
**Why:** Team members won't push back on clients the way you will. You own this.

### 6. Strategic Vision + Positioning
**Why:** Only you know where you're taking this business. Can't delegate.

### 7. First Kickoff Call (per client)
**Why:** Sets the tone. They need to meet you. After that, coordinator can handle updates.

### 8. Final QA + Launch Approval
**Why:** Your reputation is on the line. You check before it goes live.

## AUTOMATION STACK (RECOMMENDED)

| Function | Tool | Cost | Why |
|----------|------|------|-----|
| CRM | HubSpot Free or Notion | Free | Simple, scalable, integrates |
| Scheduling | Calendly or Cal.com | $10/mo or free | Standard, reliable |
| Contracts | Bonsai or PandaDoc | $24/mo | All-in-one (contracts + invoices) |

| Invoicing | Stripe Invoicing | 2.9% fee | Easy, professional |
| Email | Gmail + HubSpot | Free | Good enough |
| Forms | Typeform or Tally | $25/mo or free | Better than Google Forms |

**Total cost: $100-$150/month for full stack**

---

## AUTOMATION IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Before You Automate Anything:

- [ ] Document current manual process (write it down step-by-step)
- [ ] Identify what's repetitive vs what requires judgment
- [ ] Estimate time spent per week on this task
- [ ] Calculate ROI: If automation costs $50/mo and saves 3 hours/week, is it worth it?
- [ ] Test automation with 1-2 instances before fully committing
- [ ] Monitor for 2 weeks to ensure it works reliably
- [ ] Document the automation (so team knows how it works)

### Red Flags (Don't Automate If):

- Process changes frequently (automation will break constantly)
- Requires human judgment in every case (not automatable)
- Costs more than your time is worth
- Makes experience worse for clients (robotic, impersonal)
- You can't explain how it works (creates dependency on tools)

## MONTH-BY-MONTH AUTOMATION PRIORITIES

| Month | Priority Automation | Why Now | Time Saved |
|-------|-------------------|---------|------------|
| 0-3 | Lead routing, booking, proposals, contracts | Foundation for growth | 5 hours/week |
| 3-6 | Onboarding emails, update templates, feedback | Scaling client base | 4 hours/week |
| 6-9 | Project templates, time tracking, docs | Adding team members | 6 hours/week |
| 9-12 | Lead qualification, client portal, metrics | Operating at scale | 6 hours/week |

**Cumulative time saved by Month 12: ~20 hours/week**

That's 2.5 workdays freed up for sales, strategy, and growth.

---

## METRICS TO TRACK

| Metric | Target | Measure |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Time spent on admin/ops | Under 10 hours/week | Time tracking |
| Response time to leads | Under 4 hours | CRM timestamps |
| Proposal turnaround | Under 24 hours | CRM timestamps |
| Client update consistency | 100% on time | Project tracking |
| Team autonomy | 80% of tasks done without your input | Weekly review |

## COMMON AUTOMATION MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Automating too early
**Problem:** You don't have enough volume to justify the setup time.
**Fix:** Wait until you're doing something 5+ times per week before automating.

### Mistake 2: Over-automating client communication
**Problem:** Clients feel like they're talking to a robot.
**Fix:** Use templates, but personalize. Automation should feel human.

### Mistake 3: Building complex multi-tool automations
**Problem:** One tool breaks, whole thing fails. Hard to debug.
**Fix:** Keep automations simple. 2-3 steps max.

### Mistake 4: Not documenting your automations
**Problem:** Something breaks, you forgot how it works.
**Fix:** Document every automation (where, what, why, how to fix).

### Mistake 5: Automating judgment calls
**Problem:** Edge cases break the automation, or it makes bad decisions.
**Fix:** Automate data movement, not decisions.

## WHEN TO HIRE VS WHEN TO AUTOMATE

| Task | Automate | Hire |
|------|----------|------|
| Lead routing | ✅ | ❌ |
| Booking calls | ✅ | ❌ |
| Sending contracts | ✅ | ❌ |
| Discovery calls | ❌ | ❌ (You do this) |
| Client updates | ⚠️ Template + Human | ✅ (Project Coordinator) |
| Project execution | ❌ | ✅ (Developer) |
| QA testing | ⚠️ Partial (automated tests) | ✅ (Developer or QA) |
| Scheduling | ✅ | ❌ |
| Invoicing | ✅ | ❌ |
| Bookkeeping | ❌ | ✅ (Accountant, later) |

**Rule of thumb:**
- Automate: Data movement, reminders, scheduling, templates
- Hire: Execution, judgment, client relationships, complex work

---

## 12-MONTH VISION: WHAT YOUR DAY LOOKS LIKE

### Before Automation (Month 0):
- 8am-10am: Respond to leads, schedule calls, send proposals
- 10am-12pm: Discovery calls
- 12pm-1pm: Lunch + admin
- 1pm-6pm: Client project work (coding, design, architecture)
- 6pm-8pm: Client updates, emails, follow-ups

**Result:** 60-hour weeks, exhausted, can't take on more clients.

---

### After Automation (Month 12):
- 8am-9am: Review overnight activity (automated lead routing, bookings)
- 9am-12pm: Discovery calls (booked via Calendly)
- 12pm-1pm: Lunch
- 1pm-3pm: Architecture + hard technical problems (team handles execution)
- 3pm-4pm: Review team progress (5-min check-ins)
- 4pm-5pm: Strategic work (pricing, positioning, hiring, process improvement)

**Result:** 40-hour weeks, growing revenue, team handles execution, you focus on high-value activities.

---

## FINAL RULES

### Rule 1: Automate friction, not relationships.
Clients should feel cared for, not processed. Use automation to remove annoying steps, not to remove YOU.

### Rule 2: Start simple, add complexity slowly.
Don't build a 15-step Zapier flow on Day 1. Start with 1-2 automations, master them, then add more.

### Rule 3: Monitor your automations weekly.
Things break. Check that emails are sending, data is flowing, nothing's stuck.

### Rule 4: Document everything.
Future you (or your team) will thank you when something breaks and you can actually fix it.

### Rule 5: Your time is worth $200-$500/hour (as founder).
If an automation costs $50/mo and saves 2 hours/month, it's not worth it. If it saves 2 hours/week, it's a no-brainer.

**Automate intelligently. Scale sustainably. Keep the human touch.**
