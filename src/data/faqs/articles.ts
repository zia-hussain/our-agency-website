    question: "What topics do Zumetrix Labs articles focus on?",
    answer:
      "Our articles focus on the things we work on every day: SaaS product development, MVP strategy, real engineering decisions, automation workflows, AI integrations, practical React/Next.js patterns, backend architecture choices, and lessons learned from building dashboards, mobile apps, and internal tools for real clients. We write about what we actually do—not generic theory—so founders and engineers can apply the insights immediately."
  },
  {
    question: "Who writes the articles at Zumetrix Labs?",
    answer:
      "All articles are written by the founders, Zia Hussain and Syed Omer Shah. Both write from real-world experience while building live products, solving hard problems, fixing broken systems, and guiding founders from idea to launch. The articles reflect our actual work: architecture decisions, automation frameworks, product thinking, development trade-offs, and the patterns we’ve refined across dozens of real projects."
  },
  {
    question: "How often do you publish new insights?",
    answer:
      "We publish new content as we learn, build, and solve problems—sometimes weekly, sometimes in deep batches. Our priority is to share ideas that are genuinely useful: how to scope an MVP, how to design a dashboard, how to build an automation workflow, how to avoid common startup mistakes, and how to think clearly about technology choices. When we write, it’s because we have something real to say."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I request topics for future articles?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If you’re a founder, operator, or developer facing a challenge—SaaS architecture, automation strategy, technical decisions, UI/UX questions, or MVP planning—you can request a topic and we may cover it. Many of our most valuable articles come from questions clients or founders asked us during real projects."
