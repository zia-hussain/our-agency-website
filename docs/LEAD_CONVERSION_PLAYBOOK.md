## 🧲 HOW TO GUIDE VISITORS TOWARD CONVERSION

### Principle: THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE

```
Awareness → Interest → Trust → Intent → Action
```

### Strategy 1: MULTIPLE TOUCHPOINTS
**Don't rely on ONE CTA**

Place conversion opportunities at:
- Top of page (hero)
- Middle of page (after trust building)
- Bottom of page (final CTA)
- Floating widget (always visible)

### Strategy 2: MATCH INTENT TO CTA

**Low Intent Visitors:**
- "Learn More" → Articles
- "View Portfolio" → Case studies
- "See Our Process" → Services

**Medium Intent Visitors:**
- "Get a Quote" → Contact
- "Schedule Call" → Calendar link
- "View Pricing" → Services

**High Intent Visitors:**
- "Start Your Project" → Contact
- "Let's Talk" → Contact
- "Book Consultation" → Calendar

### Strategy 3: REDUCE FRICTION

**Bad Example:**
- 15-field form
- Requires phone number, address, company size
- No indication of what happens next

**Good Example (Current):**
- 6 simple fields (name, email, company, project type, budget, message)
- Clear "Submit" button
- Success message tells them you'll respond in 24 hours

### Strategy 4: BUILD URGENCY (Optional)

**Ethical Urgency Tactics:**
- "Accepting 2 new clients this month"
- "Next available start date: January 15"
- "Limited spots for Q1 2026"

**Never:**
- Fake countdown timers
- False scarcity
- Pushy sales tactics

## 💡 WHAT TO DO WHEN A LEAD COMES IN

### STEP 1: RESPOND WITHIN 24 HOURS (Ideally 6 Hours)

**Why:**
- Fast response = professionalism
- They may be talking to competitors
- Strike while interest is hot
