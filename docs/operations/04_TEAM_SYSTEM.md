# TEAM SYSTEM
**Last Updated:** Dec 2025
**For:** Zumetrix Labs - How to Scale From 1 to 5 Without Losing Your Mind

---

## REALITY CHECK FIRST

**You can't do everything forever.**

At some point, one of three things happens:
1. You burn out
2. You turn away good clients
3. Quality drops

**The goal:** Build a small, high-trust team that lets you focus on what only you can do (sales, vision, key client relationships).

**The trap:** Hiring too fast, hiring the wrong people, or refusing to delegate.

---

## FIRST 3 ROLES TO HIRE (IN ORDER)

### HIRE #1: LEAD DEVELOPER (MONTHS 3-6)

**When to hire:**
- You're turning away projects because you're at capacity
- You're working 50+ hours/week consistently
- You have 2+ months of revenue saved

**What they do:**
- Execute on projects you scope/architect
- Handle implementation (you oversee)
- Own code quality and testing
- Eventually lead projects end-to-end

**What you still do:**
- Sales + discovery calls
- Project architecture + tech decisions
- Client communication
- QA + final review
- Scope definition

**Skills to prioritize:**
1. **Execution speed** (ships fast, doesn't overthink)
2. **Full-stack capability** (React + backend, databases)
3. **Low ego** (takes feedback, doesn't argue about tools)
4. **Communication** (can explain technical things simply)
5. **Self-directed** (doesn't need hand-holding)

**Where to find them:**
- Upwork (seriously—test before committing)
- Referrals from dev friends
- Twitter/X (developers with portfolios)
- Indie hacker communities

**Test project:**
Give them a small paid trial (1-2 weeks, $1K-$2K):
- Build a simple CRUD feature from spec you provide
- Judge: Speed, code quality, communication, how they handle feedback

**Red flags:**
- Over-engineers everything
- Argues about tech stack
- Misses deadlines without communicating
- Poor code documentation
- Can't explain decisions clearly

**Pay:**
- Contract: $50-$80/hour (depending on location/skill)
- Full-time: $60K-$90K (if you're ready for that commitment)

**Start part-time, scale to full-time as projects grow.**

---

### HIRE #2: PROJECT COORDINATOR / CLIENT SUCCESS (MONTHS 6-9)

**When to hire:**
- You're managing 3+ simultaneous projects
- Client communication is eating 10+ hours/week
- You're dropping balls on follow-ups, updates, scheduling

**What they do:**
- Send client updates (you provide content, they format/send)
- Schedule calls and meetings
- Track project milestones
- Chase clients for feedback/decisions
- Handle basic client questions
- Manage CRM and project boards
- Onboarding coordination

**What you still do:**
- Discovery calls
- Kickoff calls
- Technical decisions
- Scope protection
- Complex client conversations

**Skills to prioritize:**
1. **Organized** (doesn't let things slip)
2. **Proactive** (follows up without being told)
3. **Clear communicator** (writes well, no fluff)
4. **Client-friendly** (professional, not robotic)
5. **Tech-savvy enough** (understands basics of what you build)

**Where to find them:**
- Virtual assistant agencies (Belay, Boldly)
- Remote job boards (We Work Remotely, Remote OK)
- Referrals from other agency owners

**Test project:**
Give them a trial week ($500-$800):
- Manage 1 active project's updates and scheduling
- Organize project docs
- Send client communication from templates you provide

**Red flags:**
- Misses follow-ups
- Sends sloppy emails (typos, unclear)
- Needs too much direction
- Can't handle mildly difficult clients

**Pay:**
- Part-time: $20-$30/hour (10-20 hours/week)
- Full-time: $40K-$55K (when volume justifies it)

---

### HIRE #3: SECOND DEVELOPER OR DESIGNER (MONTHS 9-12)

**When to hire:**
- You and dev #1 are at capacity
- Projects are getting bigger (need parallel work streams)
- You're consistently landing $30K+ projects

**Option A: Second Developer**
- Lets you take on 2 projects simultaneously
- Faster delivery on large projects
- Backup if dev #1 is unavailable

**Option B: Designer (UI/UX)**
- Elevates quality of deliverables
- Allows you to charge more
- Lets developers focus on code, not design

**Which to hire first:**
- **Choose Dev #2 if:** Speed is your bottleneck
- **Choose Designer if:** Quality/polish is your differentiator

**Skills + hiring process:** Same as Hire #1 (developer) or tailor for design role.

**Pay:**
- Developer: Same as Hire #1 ($50-$80/hour or $60K-$90K)
- Designer: $40-$70/hour or $50K-$75K

## WHAT YOU DELEGATE VS WHAT STAYS WITH YOU

### YOU MUST KEEP (FOUNDER-ONLY)

| Task | Why You Can't Delegate |
|------|----------------------|
| Sales + Discovery Calls | You're the authority. Clients buy YOU. |
| Pricing + Proposals | Your judgment on scope + value. |
| Technical Architecture | Quality depends on this. You're best at it (for now). |
| Scope Protection | You need to say no. Team won't. |
| High-stakes client conversations | When things go wrong, they want the founder. |
| Hiring decisions | Your team quality = your agency quality. |
| Vision + positioning | Only you know where this is going. |

### YOU SHOULD DELEGATE (AS SOON AS POSSIBLE)

| Task | Delegate To | When |
|------|-------------|------|
| Implementation | Lead Developer | Month 3-6 |
| Client updates | Project Coordinator | Month 6-9 |
| Scheduling | Project Coordinator | Month 6-9 |
| QA testing | Lead Developer (later: QA person) | Month 3-6 |
| Documentation | Lead Developer | Month 3-6 |
| CRM management | Project Coordinator | Month 6-9 |
| Basic client questions | Project Coordinator | Month 6-9 |
| Social media / content | Hire #4: Marketer (Month 12+) | Later |

---

## TRIAL HIRING PROCESS (USE FOR EVERY HIRE)

### Step 1: Write Clear Job Description

**Don't write:**
"We're looking for a rockstar developer to join our amazing team and disrupt the industry."

**Write:**
"We're hiring a full-stack developer to build SaaS MVPs and dashboards for clients. You'll work on 2-3 projects simultaneously, ship fast, and communicate clearly. React + Node + Supabase stack. Remote, contract to start."

**Include:**
- What you actually build
- Tech stack
- Hours expected
- Pay range
- Trial project required

### Step 2: Screen Applicants (5 min per)

**Reject immediately if:**
- Generic cover letter ("Dear Hiring Manager")
- Portfolio doesn't match your type of work
- Rates wildly above/below market
- Red flags in communication (unprofessional, sloppy)

**Shortlist if:**
- Portfolio shows similar projects
- Clear, concise communication
- Realistic about availability and rates
- Asks good questions

### Step 3: Quick Interview Call (15-20 min)

**Questions to ask:**

1. "Walk me through a recent project. What'd you build, how long did it take, any challenges?"
   (Listen for: Clarity, problem-solving, ownership)

2. "What's your process when you get stuck on something?"
   (Listen for: Resourcefulness, communication)

3. "How do you handle tight deadlines?"
   (Listen for: Realism, stress management)

4. "What kind of clients or projects do you NOT want to work on?"
   (Listen for: Self-awareness, alignment)

5. "What's your availability, and what's your rate?"
   (Listen for: Honesty, no games)

### Step 4: Paid Trial Project (1-2 Weeks)

**Give them a real task** (not fake work):
- Scoped feature from actual client project
- Clear requirements
- Realistic deadline
- Budget: $500-$2K depending on scope

**Judge them on:**
- Code quality (clean, documented, works)
- Speed (did they hit deadline?)
- Communication (did they update you, ask questions?)
- Feedback response (how'd they handle revision requests?)

**After trial:**
- **Hire:** "Great work. Let's keep going. Here's next project..."
- **Don't hire:** "Thanks for your time. Not the right fit. Here's payment."

**Don't ghost people. Pay them. Move on.**

---

## PERFORMANCE TRACKING (SIMPLE)

### Weekly Check-In (15 min per person)

**Three questions:**
1. "What'd you ship this week?"
2. "What's blocking you?"
3. "What do you need from me?"

**That's it. Don't over-complicate.**

### Monthly Review (30 min per person)

**Discuss:**
- Quality of work (any client complaints? Bugs? Revisions?)
- Speed of delivery (hitting deadlines?)
- Communication (responsive? Clear?)
- Growth areas (what can they improve?)

**Use this format:**

| Area | Rating (1-5) | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Code Quality | 4 | Clean, well-documented |
| Speed | 5 | Always hits deadlines |
| Communication | 3 | Needs to ask more questions upfront |
| Client Feedback | 5 | Clients love working with them |

**Ratings:**
- 5 = Exceptional
- 4 = Great
- 3 = Acceptable (needs improvement)
- 2 = Below expectations (address immediately)
- 1 = Unacceptable (fire or PIP)

## WHEN TO FIRE VS WHEN TO COACH

### COACH IF:

| Issue | How to Coach |
|-------|-------------|
| Missing occasional deadlines | "I noticed you missed [X]. What happened? How can we prevent it?" |
| Code quality issues (fixable) | "Let's review this together. Here's what I'd change and why." |
| Poor communication (rare) | "I need you to update me daily at EOD. Can you commit to that?" |
| Learning curve on new tech | "Let's pair on this for an hour. I'll show you our approach." |

**Give them 2-4 weeks to improve. Track progress.**

### FIRE IF:

| Issue | Why You Can't Fix It |
|-------|---------------------|
| Consistently misses deadlines without warning | Lack of accountability. Won't change. |
| Defensive about feedback | Ego problem. Will get worse. |
| Poor communication (chronic) | You'll spend more time managing than they save you. |
| Sloppy work that requires heavy revisions | Quality standard mismatch. Not worth it. |
| Unreliable (disappears, excuses) | Trust is gone. You can't scale without trust. |
| Doesn't follow your process | Chaos multiplier. Fire fast. |

**How to fire (contract):**
"Hey [Name], this isn't working out. I'm ending the contract effective [date]. Here's your final payment for work completed. Thanks for your time."

**Don't over-explain. Don't apologize. Pay them. Move on.**

---

## RED FLAGS DURING HIRING

| Red Flag | What It Means | What To Do |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Constant rescheduling | Unreliable. Will happen during projects too. | Don't hire. |
| Over-promises during interview | Will under-deliver once hired. | Test heavily before committing. |
| Badmouths previous clients | Will do same to you. | Hard pass. |
| Vague about availability | Not serious or juggling too much. | Ask for specifics. If still vague, pass. |
| Negotiates aggressively upfront | Will be difficult to work with. | Walk away. |
| Portfolio doesn't match what they claim | Lying or exaggerating. | Don't hire. |

**Trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is.**

---

## TEAM COMMUNICATION STRUCTURE

### Daily Standups (ASYNC, NOT MEETINGS)

Each person posts in Slack/Discord/Notion by 9 AM:
1. What I shipped yesterday
2. What I'm working on today
3. Any blockers

**No meeting required. Just read and respond if needed.**

### Weekly Sync (30 min, whole team)

**Agenda:**
- Project status updates (5 min each project)
- Blockers / questions (10 min)
- Next week's priorities (10 min)
- Open discussion (5 min)

**Keep it tight. No rambling.**

### Monthly All-Hands (Optional, 60 min)

**Discuss:**
- Revenue update (where are we financially?)
- Wins (successful launches, good client feedback)
- Lessons learned (what went wrong, how we fix it)
- Process improvements
- Team feedback

**Purpose:** Keep everyone aligned and motivated.

---

## COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY

### Pay fairly, but don't overpay early.

**Contract roles (first 6-12 months):**
- Lower financial risk for you
- Flexibility to scale up/down
- Easier to end if not working out

**Full-time roles (once stable):**
- Better retention
- Deeper commitment
- Health benefits (if in US)

### Raises / Bonuses

**Give raises when:**
- They've been with you 6+ months
- Performance is consistently great (4-5 ratings)
- Revenue supports it

**How much:**
- 5-10% annual raise (if performance warrants)
- Bonus: 5-15% of salary for exceptional work

**Don't promise equity early.** It complicates things. Cash is simpler.

## SCALING TIMELINE (REALISTIC)

| Month | Team Size | Revenue Target | What You're Doing |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 0-3 | Just you | $10K-$20K/mo | Everything (sales, delivery, ops) |
| 3-6 | You + Dev #1 | $20K-$40K/mo | Sales, architecture, client relationships |
| 6-9 | You + Dev #1 + Coordinator | $40K-$60K/mo | Sales, architecture, key decisions |
| 9-12 | You + 2 Devs + Coordinator | $60K-$100K/mo | Sales, vision, team management |
| 12+ | You + 2-3 Devs + Coordinator + Designer/Marketer | $100K-$150K/mo | Sales, strategic decisions, growth |

**Don't rush this.** Hire when revenue supports it, not before.

## FINAL RULES

### Rule 1: Hire slow, fire fast.
Bad hires cost you money, time, and client relationships. Take your time. Test thoroughly. If it's not working, end it quickly.

### Rule 2: You're not building a family, you're building a business.
Be kind. Be fair. But don't tolerate underperformance out of guilt.

### Rule 3: Delegate outcomes, not tasks.
Don't say "code this feature exactly like this." Say "build a user dashboard that shows X, Y, Z. Here's the goal." Let them figure out how.

### Rule 4: Protect your time fiercely.
The goal of hiring is to free you up for high-value work (sales, vision, growth). If hiring just creates more management overhead, you hired wrong.

### Rule 5: Trust, but verify.
Give people autonomy, but check their work. Especially early on.

**Building a team is how you scale. Doing it wrong is how you kill your agency.**

**Do it right.**
