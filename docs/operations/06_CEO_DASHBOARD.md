# CEO DASHBOARD
**Last Updated:** Dec 2025
**For:** Zumetrix Labs - What You Must Track Weekly to Stay Alive and Grow

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

**You can't manage what you don't measure.**

Most agency founders fly blind. They're "busy" but don't know if they're making money. They're "hustling" but don't know if their pipeline is drying up.

**This dashboard tells you:**
- Are we healthy or dying?
- Where should I focus this week?
- What's about to break?

**Review this every Monday morning. Takes 15 minutes. Could save your business.**

## THE 7 METRICS THAT MATTER

### 1. PIPELINE HEALTH

**What to track:**
- Active leads (discovery calls scheduled)
- Proposals out (waiting for decision)
- Expected close value (total $ of open deals)
- Win rate (proposals → deals closed)

**How to measure:**

| Metric | Formula | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Active Leads | Count in CRM | 5-10 | 2-4 | 0-1 |
| Proposals Out | Count pending | 2-5 | 1 | 0 |
| Pipeline Value | Sum of all open deals | 2-3x monthly revenue target | 1-2x | Under 1x |
| Win Rate | (Closed Won / Total Proposals) | 40-60% | 25-40% | Under 25% |

**What it tells you:**
- **Healthy:** You have a steady flow of potential work coming in.
- **Warning:** Pipeline is thinning. Need to generate more leads.
- **Critical:** You're about to run out of work. Drop everything and do sales.

**Action triggers:**
- Pipeline under 2x monthly target → Spend 10 hours this week on outreach
- Win rate under 30% → Your pricing is wrong or you're targeting bad leads
- 0 proposals out → You have a lead generation problem

---

### 2. CASH POSITION

**What to track:**
- Current cash in bank
- Outstanding invoices (owed to you)
- Upcoming expenses (payroll, contractors, tools)
- Runway (months you can survive at current burn)

**How to measure:**

| Metric | Formula | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Cash in Bank | Check balance | 3+ months expenses | 1-3 months | Under 1 month |
| Runway | Cash ÷ Monthly Burn | 6+ months | 3-6 months | Under 3 months |
| Outstanding Invoices | Sum of unpaid invoices | Under 30 days old | 30-60 days | Over 60 days |
| Days to Broke | Cash ÷ Daily Burn | 180+ days | 90-180 days | Under 90 days |

**What it tells you:**
- **Healthy:** You can weather slow months and invest in growth.
- **Warning:** You need to collect payments faster or cut costs.
- **Critical:** You're weeks away from not making payroll.

**Action triggers:**
- Runway under 3 months → Stop all non-essential spending, chase overdue invoices
- Invoice over 30 days unpaid → Follow up aggressively (call, don't email)
- Cash under 1 month expenses → Emergency sales mode (discount to close fast if needed)

---

### 3. REVENUE METRICS

**What to track:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) - from retainers
- Project revenue this month
- Total revenue this month
- Revenue last month (for comparison)
- Revenue growth rate

**How to measure:**

| Metric | Formula | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Monthly Revenue | MRR + Project Revenue | $40K+ (by month 6) | $20K-$40K | Under $20K |
| Revenue Growth | (This Month - Last Month) ÷ Last Month | +10-30% MoM | 0-10% | Negative |
| MRR % of Total | MRR ÷ Total Revenue | 30-50% (ideal) | 10-30% | Under 10% |
| Avg Deal Size | Total Revenue ÷ Projects Closed | $25K+ | $15K-$25K | Under $15K |

**What it tells you:**
- **Healthy:** Growing consistently, not feast-or-famine.
- **Warning:** Revenue is flat or unpredictable.
- **Critical:** Revenue is shrinking or too low to sustain business.

**Action triggers:**
- Revenue declining 2 months in a row → Fix sales process or raise prices
- MRR under 20% → Offer retainers to past clients (ongoing support)

### 4. DELIVERY HEALTH

**What to track:**
- Active projects (currently in progress)
- Projects on time vs delayed
- Client satisfaction (1-10 scale)
- Scope creep incidents
- Team utilization (hours worked vs hours available)

**How to measure:**

### 7. FOUNDER TIME ALLOCATION

**What to track:**
- Hours spent on sales
- Hours spent on delivery
- Hours spent on operations/admin
- Hours spent on strategy/growth
- Total hours worked

**How to measure:**

**What it tells you:**

- **Warning:** You're stuck in the weeds (delivery, admin).
- **Critical:** You're working IN the business, not ON it. Can't scale.

**Action triggers:**
- Delivery over 40% → Hire a developer or you'll never scale.
- Operations over 30% → Automate or hire coordinator.
- Sales under 20% → Pipeline will dry up in 2-3 months. Prioritize sales NOW.
- Strategy under 10% → You're in firefighting mode. Not sustainable.
- Total hours over 60 → Burnout incoming. Delegate or cut scope.

## RED FLAGS (ACT IMMEDIATELY)

| Red Flag | What It Means | Action Required |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Pipeline value under 1x monthly revenue | You're about to run out of work | Cancel everything, do 20 hours of sales this week |
| Cash runway under 2 months | Business is weeks from dying | Collect invoices, close deals fast (discount if needed), cut costs |
| 3+ projects delayed | Delivery is broken | Stop taking new work, fix what's broken, hire help |
| Win rate under 20% for 2+ months | Your offer is wrong | Reposition, reprice, or retarget audience |
| No discovery calls for 2+ weeks | Lead gen is dead | Fix website, run ads, do outreach, ask for referrals |
| Team member quits suddenly | Culture or overwork problem | Exit interview, fix root cause immediately |
| Founder working 70+ hours for 4+ weeks | Burnout imminent | Force yourself to take a week off or hire NOW |

**These are "drop everything" moments. Nothing else matters if these are broken.**

## DECISION POINTS (WEEKLY)

### Every Monday Morning, Ask Yourself:

**1. What's our biggest constraint right now?**
- Not enough leads? → Focus on sales/marketing this week.
- Not enough capacity? → Hire or turn away work.
- Cash flow tight? → Chase invoices, close deals faster.
- Quality slipping? → Slow down, fix processes.

**2. What metric is in the "warning" or "critical" zone?**
- Fix it THIS WEEK. Don't let it fester.

**3. What can I delegate this week that I'm still doing?**
- If you're doing low-value work, you're stealing time from high-value work.

**4. What's the highest-leverage activity I can do this week?**
- Usually: Sales calls, key client relationships, hiring, or fixing broken systems.

**5. Am I working ON the business or IN the business?**
- If over 50% of your time is delivery/admin, you're stuck. Change it.

---

## WHAT TO FOCUS ON BY STAGE

### MONTHS 0-3 (SOLO FOUNDER)
**Primary focus:**
- Pipeline (always be selling)
- Cash (don't run out of money)
- Delivery (ship on time, build reputation)

**Secondary:**
- Revenue growth
- Time allocation

**Ignore for now:**
- Team metrics (you don't have a team yet)
- Advanced sales metrics

---

### MONTHS 3-6 (FOUNDER + FIRST HIRE)
**Primary focus:**
- Pipeline (still critical)
- Revenue growth (need to support team)
- Team performance (is your hire working out?)
- Delivery health (maintaining quality with team)

**Secondary:**
- Sales efficiency
- Founder time allocation

---

### MONTHS 6-12 (FOUNDER + SMALL TEAM)
**Primary focus:**
- All 7 metrics matter now
- Especially: Team performance, delivery health, founder time allocation
- Goal: Move from "doing" to "leading"

**You should be watching:**
- Are systems working without me?
- Is the team autonomous?
- Am I still the bottleneck?

---

## FINAL RULES

### Rule 1: What gets measured gets managed.
If you're not tracking it, you can't improve it. Pick your metrics, track them religiously.

### Rule 2: Metrics without action are useless.
Don't just look at numbers. Decide what to DO based on them.

### Rule 3: Red flags are gifts.
They tell you what's broken BEFORE it kills your business. Pay attention.

### Rule 4: You can't manage what you don't make time to review.
Block Monday morning for this. Non-negotiable. 15 minutes could save your agency.

### Rule 5: The goal is not perfection, it's progress.
You'll never hit "healthy" on every metric. But if most are trending right, you're winning.

**Track. Decide. Act. Repeat.**

**That's how you build an agency that doesn't collapse the moment you take a vacation.**
