      "Yes. We’ve worked with founders and teams across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East. Some examples include: a publishing analytics dashboard for a Norwegian company, an AI-powered voice companion app for a US startup, a handyman marketplace for a Norwegian founder, a skill-swapping mobile app for a UK client, a livestock management system for an American ranch, and multiple automation-heavy systems built using Make.com and n8n.

    question: "What industries does your portfolio cover?",
    answer:
      "Our work spans several industries including publishing, healthcare, service marketplaces, logistics, automation, AI, education, e-commerce, and operational tooling. We build both customer-facing products and internal business systems. Because our team works closely with founders and operators, we’re comfortable adapting to different industries and designing solutions that fit each client’s workflow, constraints, and long-term goals."

  {
    question: "How do you ensure the success of each project in your portfolio?",
    answer:
      "Every project is led directly by the founders, which means architecture, core features, and technical decisions are handled by senior engineers. We focus on clear scoping, weekly communication, fast iteration cycles, realistic timelines, and shipping only what matters. Most clients stay with us beyond the initial build because our approach reduces friction, avoids overbuilding, and ensures the final product is stable, maintainable, and aligned with the client’s goals. Our priority is not just delivering software—it’s making sure the product actually works in the real world."
