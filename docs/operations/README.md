## 💡 PHILOSOPHY

**This is not generic advice.**

Every system here is built for:
- Premium positioning (not price competition)
- Small team (2-5 people)
- Services: SaaS MVPs, dashboards, automation
- Founder who wants to scale without losing quality

**No fluff. No theory. Just what works.**

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

| Metric | Month 3 | Month 6 | Month 12 |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Revenue | $20K/mo | $40K/mo | $80K/mo |
| Team Size | 1-2 | 2-3 | 3-4 |
| Founder Hours | 50-60/wk | 40-50/wk | 30-40/wk |
| Cash Runway | 2+ months | 3+ months | 6+ months |
| Projects/Month | 2-3 | 3-4 | 4-6 |

---

## ⚠️ RED FLAGS (ACT IMMEDIATELY)

- Pipeline value under 1x monthly revenue
- Cash runway under 2 months
- 3+ projects delayed simultaneously
- Win rate under 20% for 2+ months
- No discovery calls for 2+ weeks
- Founder working 70+ hours for 4+ weeks

**See [CEO Dashboard](./06_CEO_DASHBOARD.md) for full list and actions.**

---

## 🎯 THE 3 THINGS THAT MATTER

1. **SALES** - If pipeline dries up, you die. Spend 30-40% of time here.
2. **DELIVERY** - If you ship shit, clients leave. Maintain quality.
3. **CASH** - If you run out of money, game over. Track weekly.

Everything else is secondary.

## 📈 EXPECTED TIMELINE

- **Month 0-3:** Exhausting (building while executing)
- **Month 3-6:** Risky (first hire, cash tight)
- **Month 6-9:** Momentum (systems click, team contributes)
- **Month 9-12:** Scale (autonomous team, founder as CEO)

**This is normal. Push through the hard parts.**
